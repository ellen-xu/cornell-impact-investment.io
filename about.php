          <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
          <p> "Given our global political climate, it has become more important
            now than ever before to understand and take responsibility for the
            implications of our actions as citizens of the world. I strongly
            believe that impact investing allows people the opportunity to
            do just that, supporting ventures that create paths toward a
            healthier planet. Impact investing though projected to be the
            upcoming trend within the world of finance, really hasnâ€™t reached
            the mainstream yet. Thus our purpose of founding CII, one of the
            only impact investing undergraduate clubs in the country, was to
            take on a pioneering role and allow more people the opportunity
            to learn and get involved in impact investing. In this way, our
            hope for CII is to not only bring in people with prior finance
            experience, but to expand the scope of this niche to people of
            different backgrounds and skillsets." </p>

        <h1>What is Impact Investing?</h1>
        <div class="centEd">
          <p>Impact investment is a type of investment made from companies, organizations, and funds with the purpose of
            generating social and environmental impact as well as a financial return. Impact investments are
            commonly made in both emerging and developed markets. These investments have a range of returns from below
            market to market rate, depending on investors' strategic goals. </p>

              <h1>Why Impact Investing?</h1>
              <p>Impact investing is innovative and challenges the long-held views that social and environmental issues
                should be only addressed by philanthropic donations and that market investments should exclusively
                concentrate on achieving financial returns.</p>

                <p>The impact investing market offers viable and a diversity of opportunities for
                  investors to advance social and environmental solutions through investments
                  which also produce financial returns.</p>
